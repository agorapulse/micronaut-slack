Micronaut Slack is more idiomatic alternative to https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/supported-web-frameworks#micronaut[Bolt Micronaut] library
for https://api.slack.com[Slack API] integration into the Micronaut applications.

The main difference compared to https://slack.dev/java-slack-sdk/guides/supported-web-frameworks#micronaut[Bolt Micronaut]

* Using https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/#config[Micronaut configuration chain] to configure Bolt's `AppConfig`
* Main bolt classes such as `Slack`, `App` and `MethodsClient` available as beans
* Ability to define handlers as standalone beans out of the box
* Beans to list all installed applications
* Events for pre/post bot installation
* Preventing Bolt event duplicate handling
